Instructions for Use of New Min Max board:

--PLOTTING--
	Use run_minmax_rs485_plot.bat. There are two arguments you will need to change regularly:
	1: "-n"
		Set this to the number of connected motors plus two.
	2: "-zp"
		Set this to 1 if you are using an RS485 dongle, and 0 if you are using a UART dongle.

--BINARY TOGGLES--
	Enable for Basic Min Max Functionality:
		Toggle 40: enable min max feature (otherwise it'll behave like a hand on version 2.33)
		Toggle 42: disable calibration on startup	
		Toggle 38: IMPORTANT! adds a quick startup check of the motor encoder.
	Enable for Min Max Plotting over RS485:
		Toggle 35: enable RS485
		Toggle 16: enable UART mode
	Other Related Toggles (not recommended except under certain specific conditions)
		Toggle 41: disable minmax overtemp safety stop (leave at 0)
		Toggle 27: Force high power mode


--VALUE COMMANDS--
	LEAVE AT ZERO UNLESS JESSE APPROVES
	All of these commands are in floating point format. The voltage settings are casted to integers. If loaded with 0, they will override to default values.
	Disregard the <>. Examples: 
		Wm008:15.1234
		Wm006:1001
		
	1. Set MIN Run Distance:
		Wm007:<argument>
			-<argument> determines the run distance in DEGREES which the motor will move during the Min run. I.e. if set to 180, it will move exactly one half rotation 
			in the positive direction, then back to 0. Default: 360
	2. Set MIN Run Time:
		Wm008:<argument>
			-<argument> determines the amount of time, in seconds, allowed for the MIN run. Default: 18.0
	3. Set MIN Voltage Saturation:			
		Wm009:<argument>
			-<argument> determines the maximum possible voltage % (out of 3546) which will be allowed during the min run. If set to 500, and the supply voltage is 8.4,
			that means the equivalent motor voltage is 1.18V. MUST BE GREATER THAN THE MIN PASS THRESH OR IT WILL ALWAYS PASS MIN NO MATTER WHAT. Default 500
	4. Set MIN Thresh
		Wm013:<argument>
			-<argument> determines the maximum voltage threshold under which the motor must stay during the MIN run in order to pass. 

	5. Set MAX Run Distance:
		Wm010:<argument>
			-<argument> determines the number of rotations moved during the max run. If 720 is sent, the DTC output shaft will move exactly two full rotations forward then two full rotations backward.
			Default: 360
	6. set MAX Run Time:
		Wm011:<argument>
			-<argument> determines the time, in seconds, that a MAX run is attempted. Default: 5.0
	7. set MAX Voltage Saturation
		Wm012:<argument>
			-<argument> determines the maximum voltage % out of 3546 that the motor is allowed to use during the MAX run. Default: 1100
	8. Set MAX Thresh:
		Wm006:<argument> 		
			-<argument> determines the voltage % (out of 3546) which will be set as the threshold for Max. All voltages for the max-run must be under this threshold	
			for you to pass max and proceed to min. Floating point format (automatically floored, so only integer value is valid. (Default: 1000)

--Example Usage Case: break in thumb rotators
	[ensure calibration is enabled]
	Wm010:60.0 		--Set range of motion to 60 degrees (all drivers assume finger DTC, so smaller ROM means faster break in)
	Wm011:0.83 		--divide normal speed by 6 to achieve faster break in times
	Wm006:1.00		--disable min transitions by lowering the pass thresh to an unobtainable value	
	Wm012:750		--lower max voltage allowed during run to reduce heat buildup when it hits the extremes of its ROM
